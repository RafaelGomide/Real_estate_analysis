The database we will use to develop the project contains data on different types of properties in Rio de Janeiro, such as apartments, houses, and commercial spaces, among others.
In this database, we will find the rental prices for each property, condominium fees, property taxes (IPTU), and also their characteristics, such as the number of bedrooms, suites, parking spaces, etc.
